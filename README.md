# COVID-19 plots

Some plots. Parameters can be shared using the URL. Pull requests welcome.

For example: Compare confirmed deaths in China, United States, and Italy in a per-capita log-plot over time:
<https://holgerdell.github.io/COVID-19-plots/#%7B%22params%22%3A%7B%22calendar%22%3A%7B%22normalize%22%3Atrue%2C%22logplot%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%2C%22countries%22%3A%5B%22China%22%2C%22United%20States%22%2C%22Italy%22%5D%7D>

URL parameter `dataset` can be set to `owid_total_deaths` (default), `owid_total_cases`, `jh_deaths`, `jh_confirmed`, and `jh_recovered`.

# Featured plots

## Calendar plot

This is the plot you see everywhere: The x-axis shows the date and the y-axis the confirmed cases at that time.

## Trajectory plot

This plots the same data, but the x-axis shows the total number of confirmed cases while the y-axis shows the number of new cases on that day.
We took the idea for this plot from a [minutephysics video](https://youtu.be/54XLXg4fYsc) and Aatish Bhatia's [implementation of the same plot](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/)

## Reproduction number over time

[Example plot](https://holgerdell.github.io/COVID-19-plots/#%7B%22plot%22%3A%22reproduction_number%22%2C%22countries%22%3A%5B%22Denmark%22%2C%22Germany%22%2C%22Sweden%22%5D%2C%22dataset%22%3A%22owid_total_cases%22%7D)

The [reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case. The x-axis shows the date as in the calendar plot, and the y-axis shows the estimated reproduction number on that day. We estimate it here by dividing the number of new cases by the number of new cases four days ago. This is a simplified version of the metric that the German [Robert-Koch-Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN) uses.

# Development

Install the development tools:
```bash
yarn install
```

Start a http server for local development:
```bash
yarn run http-server
```

Manually run the JavaScript linter [standard](https://standardjs.com/):
```bash
yarn run standard
```

Manually run the CSS linter [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/):
```bash
yarn run stylelint "**/*.css"
```

Both linters support `--fix` for automatic fixing.

Visual Studio Code provides the extensions [chenxsan.vscode-standardjs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs) and [stylelint.vscode-stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) for automatic linting.
